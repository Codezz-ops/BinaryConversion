<br>How do we convert a Binary IP to a Decimal IP</br> 
</h1>

### Let's define what a binary IP is

"01111111.00000000.00000000.00000001"
- This a Binary  IP address
 
- What is an octet an octet is 8 bits of a binary IP address 

- How long is a Binary IP address in bits a binary IP is 32 bits or 4 bytes 

### Let's explain what the binary IP address is showing us 
- To the us we see a bunch of random one's and zero's but lets look at it as a light switch and one is on and zero is off

### How to convert a binary IP to a Decimal IP
- One way you can convert a binary IP to a Decimal IP is by using the power of 2

- What are the powers of 2 we use the powers of two to convert Binary IP's to Decimal IP's

- We use the values of { 128, 64, 32, 8, 4, 2, 1 }

### How do we set it up 
- we take the one set of octets and put the binary numbers above the powers of two chart

     0   1   1   1   1  1  1  1 
<br>128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1</br>

- Once they are lined up add the numbers with a one over it


- `64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 127` 
- boom now you got the first number of the IP address
